# Regression-models
MAT 243 STEM Applied Statistics- Project Three
Competency
In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competency:
Perform regression analysis to address an authentic problem
Scenario
You are a data analyst for a basketball team and have access to a large set of historical data that you can use to analyze performance patterns. The coach of the team and your management have requested that you come up with regression models that predict the number of wins in a regular game based on the performance metrics that are included in the data set. These regression models will help make key decisions to improve the performance of the team. You will use the Python programming language to perform the statistical analyses and then prepare a report of your findings to present for the teamâ€™s management. Since the managers are not data analysts, you will need to interpret your findings and describe their practical implications.
